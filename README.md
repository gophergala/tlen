## What's Up, Doc?

Well... We want to be shy, but... This is the first in the world Android app
with native UI interface, that is completely written in Go. Ever. [Srsly](https://www.google.ru/search?q=go+android+native+ui).

There [are](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile) "official" support of
Go-development, but it's very scarce, and lack of almost everything that you
can use for app development. However, it contains strong foundation for
building somethings bigger.

So we decided to fix this unfortunate coincidence, and start developing
Go [framework](https://github.com/seletskiy/go-android-rpc), that will bring
native SDK to the [Go code](main.go).

During Gophergala 48 hour challenge, we choose to create small game
application in Go, that will show potential of developing for Android in Go.

We done [literally ton](https://github.com/seletskiy/go-android-rpc/commit/2487ab8bf4387f4de962eca84f133c2794ad36f9)
of changes into our little raw'n'tasty framework along with this game.

And now, we proudly present you *tlen*.

It is a small adventure game, were you play by little fellow, one of the many
spaceship settlers, that are traveling for 45 years to their new home.

App can crash here and there, and we are not so good plot writers.

But we hope you will enjoy it.
