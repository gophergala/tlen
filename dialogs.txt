Prologue.
~~~~~~~~~

It's been 45 years since the Expedition begun. The obvious
and rational evolution of human technologies allowed to build
safe enough space ships to explore new worlds.

A bunch of strong, hardly selected people started their journey
cherishing hope to find new better home to live. One way ticket.
No way back.


Monster action.
===============

It is pitch black. You try to make a move to escape,
but barely feel your body. Just powerful clammy darkness and strange
feeling of existence and non-existence at the same time.

1.1.[Try to move]

You feel different. Time goes different. You feel your mind wandering.

1.2.["Who are you?"]

"You? Things? Cold. Solid. Energy. Dark."

1.2.1.["Play."]
1.2.2.["Toys."]
1.2.3.["Father."]
1.2.4.["Mother."]

"Alive? Energy? Energy."

You start to feel yourself more clearly. Start to feel something
around you. And you realize the something is alive.

You don't need another eternity to understand that the something
is deadly strange, deadly dark and deadly dangerous. You feel
it doesn't even know who are you, but even more you know it want
you not to be.

2.[Run away]

It is pitch black. There is nowhere to run.

3.1.[Anger]

You feel dark presence goes away.

3.2.[Panic]

You feel pain.

3.2.1.[Anger]

You feel dark presence goes away.

You suddenly became aware of your body. Rumbling around you. Low and pleasant
rumbling. G-r-r-r-r. Like a tiger. Like a... an engines. Ginormous photon engines.
You're waking up.

You're seing you father. You're feeling bright pain.

4.[Cry]

Your father is looking at you inquiringly.

"It's a just bad dream.", he says.

5.["I've fought with a monster!"]

Your father puts you on your feet.

6.["I feel pain!"]

"You'd better see your mom. She's our lovely doctor."

7.1.["Are we home?"]

"Not yet. But it looks like we are so close". Grin touches your father's lips.

7.2.[End]

Father takes your away from Imaginarium and locks the door on magnet lock.



STAGE 1
=======

Family bunk 1
-------------

You're in your family bunk. You see 春. The door to Imaginarium is closed.

1.1.["Hey, dad! The monster was sooo scary!"]

"Huh?"

Dad turns on TV. You hear how presenter of the TV program tells you about
new planet, detected at the edge of the ship's radars range.

1.2.1.["It tried to hurt me! But I was brave."]
1.2.2.["I was so scared!"]

Dad is watching TV.

"Go see your mother. She needs to check you after hibernation."

Presenter continues to talk about all the possibilities that awaits you and 3'000
settlers on new planet.

1.2.3.[Ignore TV and dad.]

2.1.[Caress 春.]

Purr. {Vibrate, sound. `State.春++`}

2.2.[Disregard 春.]

??? Random consequences? Lol.

3.[Go outside].


Lobby 1
-------

You're in the lobby. You hear soft rumble of engines, which carries you and
your parents long before you came through the darkness of the universe.

One hundred steps upper and you will find yourself near captain's cabin. Halfway
up located a big dining room. You hear voices.

Thin red lines along the walls will bring you to medcentre.

1.1.[Go upward.]

{GOTO: Near captain's cabin}

1.2.[Go to the medroom.]

{GOTO: Medroom}

{once}
    1.3.[Stand still and listen to engines rumble.]

    G-r-r-r. You always loved the sound of engines. Pretty much as anyone on the
    ship.

    1.* choices except 1.3.
    1.3.1.[Sit on the floor and listen.]

    You almost immerse in tender voice of engines. The tone is very low and deep.
    It covers you like silk blanket. You feel floor vibrating in almost negligible
    jolts with entraining repetitive pattern.

    {if `State.春 >= 1`}
        You see 春 is coming to you.

        1.3.1.1.[Ignore 春 and pay attention to vibrating pattern on the floor.]
        You feel anxiety. You always loved engines and how they sound. You're getting
        uncomfortable.

        {`State.Anxiety++`}

        1.3.2.[Let 春 on your knees.]

        {Vibrate. `State.春++`}
    {/if}
{/once}

{once}
    1.4.[Go to the toilet near the lobby entrance.]

    You made it. It was hard successive work. You look at what you've done.
    Now you believe the monster wasn't so scary.
    {`State.Anxiety--`}
{/once}

1.5.[Listen to the distant voices.]

Distant laugh. You don't remember when you heard that last time.
{`State.Interest++`}

// {once}
//     1.6.
//     Captain: inspired. We're approaching something significant.
//     We're approaching something significant. You'll be the first to know.
// {/once}
//
// 1.7.
// Crying woman: it was so good on Earth. Sunset and autumn' colours.
// You answer your cat's name is 春. You barely understand her.


Near captain's cabin 1
----------------------

// You see lots of people fussing around.
// No one stops to talk with you.
// Every second somebody goes in on out the cabin.
//
// Directions: {Lobby}.


Medroom 1
---------

// Mother: works hard, not really interested in talking.
// You say about monster. Almost nothing in reply.
// You say about crying woman. Still nothing.
// You say you've seen captain. Nobody's home.
//
// Directions: {Lobby}.


Dining room 1
--------------

// Cook gives you some

High level logical stages
=========================

Stage 1. Dark object appeared far on the ship's way.
Stage 2. Dark object is being slightly touched by spectroanalysis.
It's a planet with a great chance to be settled.
Stage 3. Deep research made it clear the planet's been destroyed
and can't be settled. But there's some chance that resources
from planet remainings can be used to refuel.
Stage 4. Approaching the planet remainings shown that there is
absolutely no chance to refuel and that the remainings belong
to Earth.
Stage 5. No hope. Ship is dying. No one to survive.
