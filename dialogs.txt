Prologue.
~~~~~~~~~

It's been 45 years since the Expedition begun. The obvious
and rational evolution of human technologies allowed to build
safe enough space ships to explore new worlds.

A bunch of strong, hardly selected people started their journey
cherishing hope to find new better home to live. One way ticket.
No way back.



Monster action.
===============

It is pitch black. You try to make a move to escape,
but barely feel your body. Just powerful clammy darkness and strange
feeling of existence and non-existence at the same time.

1.1.[Try to move]

You feel different. Time goes different. You feel your mind wandering.

1.2.["Who are you?"]

"You? Things? Cold. Solid. Energy. Dark."

1.2.1.["Play."]
1.2.2.["Toys."]
1.2.3.["Father."]
1.2.4.["Mother."]

"Alive? Energy? Energy."

You start to feel yourself more clearly. Start to feel something
around you. And you realize the something is alive.

You don't need another eternity to understand that the something
is deadly strange, deadly dark and deadly dangerous. You feel
it doesn't even know who are you, but even more you know it want
you not to be.

2.[Run away]

It is pitch black. There is nowhere to run.

3.1.[Anger]

You feel dark presence goes away.

3.2.[Panic]

You feel pain.

3.2.1.[Anger]

You feel dark presence goes away.

You suddenly became aware of your body. Rumbling around you. Low and pleasant
rumbling. G-r-r-r-r. Like a tiger. Like a... an engines. Ginormous photon engines.
You're waking up.

You're seing you father. You're feeling bright pain.

4.[Cry]

Your father is looking at you inquiringly.

"It's a just bad dream.", he says.

5.["I've fought with a monster!"]

Your father puts you on your feet.

6.["I feel pain!"]

"You'd better see your mom. She's our lovely doctor."

7.1.["Are we home?"]

"Not yet. But it looks like we are so close". Grin touches your father's lips.

7.2.[End]

Father takes you away from Imaginarium and locks the door on magnet lock.



Stage 1
=======

[[Dark object appeared far on the ship's way.]]


Family bunk 1
-------------

You're in your family bunk. You see 春. The door to Imaginarium is closed.

1.1.["Hey, dad! The monster was sooo scary!"]

"Huh?"

Dad turns on TV. You hear how presenter of the TV program tells you about
new planet, detected at the edge of the ship's radars range.

1.2.1.["It tried to hurt me! But I was brave."]
1.2.2.["I was so scared!"]

Dad is watching TV.

"Go see your mother. She needs to check you after hibernation."

Presenter continues to talk about all the possibilities that awaits you and 3'000
settlers on new planet.

1.2.3.[Ignore TV and dad.]

2.1.[Caress 春.]

Purr. {Vibrate, sound. `State.春++`}

2.2.[Disregard 春.]

    The program interrupts on father's TV.

    Presenter:
    "Great news, everyone. Our research team discovered a huge space object.
    It seems we've found a planet. Deep research required.
    Will keep you informed."

    You:
    "Hmm, dad... What does it mean?"

    Father sighs:
    "Well..."

    TV program resumes. Dad stares at you, frowns, blinks a couple of time and
    continues to watch TV.

    You sighs in response.
{/Transition}


Lobby 1
-------

You're in the lobby. You hear soft rumble of engines, which carries you and
your parents long before you came through the darkness of the universe.

One hundred steps upper and you will find yourself near captain's cabin. Halfway
up located a big dining room. You hear voices.

Thin red lines along the walls will bring you to medcentre.

Captain is in a hurry to his cabin with a few people of his crew.
He argues with the crew. You hear he said about approaching something
significant. You never saw him so excited.

Crying woman is sitting near fountain imitation.


1.1.[Go upward.]

{GOTO: Near captain's cabin}

1.2.[Go to the medroom.]

{GOTO: Medroom}

{once}
    1.3.[Stand still and listen to engines rumble.]

    G-r-r-r. You always loved the sound of engines. Pretty much as anyone on the
    ship.

    1.* choices except 1.3.
    1.3.1.[Sit on the floor and listen.]

    You almost immerse in tender voice of engines. The tone is very low and deep.
    It covers you like silk blanket. You feel floor vibrating in almost negligible
    jolts with entraining repetitive pattern.

    {if `State.春 >= 1`}
        You see 春 is coming to you.

        1.3.1.1.[Ignore 春 and pay attention to vibrating pattern on the floor.]
        You feel anxiety. You always loved engines and how they sound. You're getting
        uncomfortable.

        {`State.Anxiety++`}

        1.3.2.[Let 春 on your knees.]

        {Vibrate. `State.春++`}
    {/if}
{/once}

1.4.[Go to the toilet near the lobby entrance.]

You made it. It was hard successive work. You look at what you've done.
Now you believe the monster wasn't so scary.
{once}
    {`State.Anxiety--`}
{/once}

1.5.[Listen to the distant voices.]

Distant laugh. You can't remember the last time you've heard it.
{`State.Interest++`}

{once}
    1.6.[Try to understand, what's captain talking about.]
    Captain catches your gaze. He interrupts his conversation and goes
    to you.

    Captain almost whispers:

    How are you, kid?
    I know, you have a dream. Believe yourself. Just believe yourself.

    Dad is watching TV. You see complicated pattern of  circles on screen.

    - 
    1.6.1.[End.]

    You catch captain's blinking glance. Captain returns to his crew.
{/once}

1.7.[Go to crying woman.]

Woman looks lost in her thoughts. You look closely and see she isn't
actually crying. She smiles with hardly perceptable smile, but her eyes
are full of tears. Woman shows strange mix of despair and happiness.

"... Yes, we worked hard all our lives. No, it won't be easy. We're not
as young as... 45 years? Yes, 45 years ago. Cryogenic chambers... Yes,
it helps, but we're getting older anyway..."

Woman rises her head and starts speaking to you.

"Do you know about sunset?"

1.7.1.[Yes, I've heard something from my teachers...]

Woman:
"Teachers... Not all of them remember what is sunrise. But they must teach...
But what else we can do... You'll help us. You'll see a lot of beautiful
sunrises."

1.7.2.[I never saw it. But I believe it's beautiful.]

Woman:
"Oh, dear. I never thought it was so important. I always knew my purpose.
This feeling, when you wake up and you know exactly what you should do.
You work hard to achieve something. And finally you got what you want.

But there comes a time when you stop looking into the future. You think
of who are you now, what is your pleasure in life...

Oh, sunshine... When I started to prepare to the Expedition, I forgot
about the world I live. It simply disappeared for me. I believe I was
right about my decision. The Earth was beautiful. But we were strong
enough. We worked hard all our lives to get here..."

Woman nodded and continued to talk to herself.

1.7.1.1.[Leave her alone.]

1.7.3.[Leave her alone.]

Woman continued to talk with herself.
