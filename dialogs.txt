Prologue.

It's been 45 years since the Expedition begun. The obvious
and rationl evolution of human technologies allowed to build
safe enough space ships to explore new worlds.

A bunch of strong, hardly selected people started their journey
cherishing hope to find new better planet to live. One way ticket.
No way back.


Monster location.

The darkness is all around you. You try to make a move to escape,
but barely feel your body. Just powerful clammy darkness and strange
feeling of existence and non-existence at the same time.

You feel different. Time goes different. You know it's thirteen
and a half eternities passed before you were able to see.

But your vision is not the regular human eyesight. It is something
about your skin and your hearing, about all your brain cells.

You start to feel yourself more clearly. Start to feel something
around you. And you realize the something is alive.

You don't need another eternity to understand that the something
is deadly strange, deadly dark and deadly dangerous. You feel
it doesn't even know about you, but even more you know it want
you not to be.

Choice: [fight], [run away].


Stage 1. Dark object appeared far on the ship's way.
Stage 2. Dark object is being slightly touched by spectroanalysis.
It's a planet with a great chance to be settled.
Stage 3. Deep research made it clear the planet's been destroyed
and can't be settled. But there's some chance that resources
from planet remainings can be used to refuel.
Stage 4. Approaching the planet remainings shown that there is
absolutely no chance to refuel and that the remainings belong
to Earth.
Stage 5. No hope. Ship is dying. No one to survive.
